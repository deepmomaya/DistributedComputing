## Distributed Protocols

This task explores various distributed systems protocols, including the multi-paxos protocol and the 2-phase distributed commit protocol.

P1 executes the multi-paxos protocol, focusing on how it ensures multiple nodes to agree on a consistent ordering of a sequence of values among multiple nodes.

P2 executes a 2-phase distributed commit protocol which involves a coordinator and multiple participants, with each node employing a timeout mechanism to handle failures and ensure consistency.
